### Hi, you most likely got rerouted to my GitHub page because my home server is down.

### I am saving energy and resources by turning my self hosted web server off at night. The server will be back online at 8 AM Eastern!

### In the mean time, here are the important links:

### [Email me here!](mailto:josh.g.codes@gmail.com)
### [My LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/josh-g-codes)
### [My GitHub](https://github.com/gradytrain)

### Current Hours of Operation are 8 AM Eastern to 12 AM Eastern
