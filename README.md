### Hi, you most likely got rerouted to my GitHub page because there was an issue with my domain or my home server is down.

### Current Hours of Operation are 8 AM to 12 AM Eastern
### If it is during operation hours than there is an issue with domain routing and I am most likely looking into it.
### I am saving energy and resources by turning my self hosted web server off at night. The server should be back online at 7 AM Eastern.

### In the mean time, here are the important links:
